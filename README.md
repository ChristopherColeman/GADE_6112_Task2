# GADE_6112_Task2

Both the ranged and melee units error in the nameField getter and setter, tried multiple different iterations but cannot get this to clear. 
The meleeUnit still errors with the lack of a ref keyword on lines 187 and 189.
The rangedUnit seems clean aside from the NameField error.
I cannot seem to apply the correct constructors to either of the building units in this code. This results in a multitude of compiler errors.
